## Title: Anomaly Detection in Real-Time ECG Signals using Machine Learning

### Overview:

This Python Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) file contains the implementation of an anomaly detection system for real-time Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using machine learning models. This research addresses the critical domain of anomaly detection in real-time ECG signals, a pivotal aspect in healthcare monitoring. The study encompasses comprehensive data preprocessing, detailed analysis of ECG graphs, and the application of diverse machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and LSTM. Among these, the Random Forest model emerged as the superior performer, showcasing precision, recall, and F1-score values for both normal and abnormal classifications. Model fairness analysis revealed variations across age groups, underscoring the need for tailored anomaly detection in different demographics. Informed by the modelâ€™s predictions, health advice recommendations were derived, emphasizing personalized interventions. For senior adults, a heightened sensitivity to abnormal heartbeats suggests the importance of regular medical assessments. Conversely, for younger age groups, lifestyle recommendations focus on heart-healthy practices. The study also proposes future work, including enhanced feature engineering and exploration of deep learning architectures, to further refine anomaly detection models. The research underscores the significance of collaboration with healthcare professionals, ethical considerations, and regular model updates for successful integration into clinical practice. These recommendations, derived from a holistic analysis, contribute not only to the advancement of anomaly detection in ECG signals but also offer actionable insights for personalized healthcare interventions.
